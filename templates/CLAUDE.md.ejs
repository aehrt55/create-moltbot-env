# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

moltbot-env is a GitOps environment configuration repository for [moltbot-app](https://github.com/<%= appRepo %>), a Cloudflare Workers application. It manages per-environment deployment configs using an overlay pattern — each overlay stores its complete `vars` block plus environment-specific config overrides, merged with the app repo's base `wrangler.jsonc` at deploy time.

## Architecture

**Overlay pattern with Make orchestration:**
- `Makefile` — shared make targets (deploy, secret, wrangler, merged-config, edit-secrets, push-secrets); derives `ROOT` via `realpath` on the symlink
- `overlays/<env>/Makefile` — symlink to `../../Makefile`; `$(CURDIR)` resolves to the overlay directory so `ENV_NAME` is auto-derived
- `overlays/<env>/wrangler.jsonc` — environment-specific Wrangler config overrides (JSONC format with comments)
- `overlays/<env>/version.txt` — pinned moltbot-app commit SHA to deploy
- `overlays/<env>/secrets.json` — SOPS-encrypted secrets (AGE encryption), committed to git
- `.sops.yaml` — path-based creation rules mapping each overlay to its AGE recipients (env key + manager key(s))
- `.moltbot-env.json` — runtime config read by scripts via `jq` (Cloudflare account IDs, repo slugs, credential sources, etc.)

**Config merging:** At deploy time, the app repo's base `wrangler.jsonc` is merged with the overlay's `wrangler.jsonc` via `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'` (recursive object merge, arrays are replaced not appended). Intermediate JSONC→JSON conversion uses process substitution — no temporary files. The `secret` and `wrangler` targets use `mktemp` for the one unavoidable temp file (`wrangler --config` requires a file path).

**Deploy flow** (`scripts/deploy.sh`): clone moltbot-app at pinned SHA → `npm ci` → merge configs via process substitution → `npx wrangler deploy` → conditionally push SOPS-encrypted secrets via `wrangler secret bulk`. All work happens in a temp directory cleaned up via `trap` on exit.

**CI/CD deploy flow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): On push to `main` (paths: `overlays/**`) or manual dispatch → detect changed overlays → matrix deploy per environment. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is a repo-level secret (shared); `SOPS_AGE_KEY` is a per-environment secret. Uses a Cloudflare **Account API Token** (not User API Token) so CI/CD is not affected when team members leave. `deploy.sh` injects `account_id` from `.moltbot-env.json` into the merged wrangler config, so the token does not need `/memberships` access. Reads `appRepo` from `.moltbot-env.json` to construct HTTPS clone URL. For private app repos, configure `APP_REPO_APP_ID` (repo variable) and `APP_REPO_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (repo secret) from a GitHub App with read access; for public repos, leave these unset.

**Secret management:** Per-environment secrets are stored as SOPS-encrypted JSON (`overlays/<env>/secrets.json`) using AGE encryption. Each `secrets.json` is encrypted to multiple recipients — the env's own AGE key + all manager keys. SOPS reads the private key from the `SOPS_AGE_KEY` environment variable. Locally, the manager's private key is loaded from credentials configured in `.moltbot-env.json`; CI/CD injects the env-specific private key as a secret env var.

**Makefile requires bash** (`SHELL := /bin/bash`) for process substitution (`<(...)`) support.

## Credentials

Scripts read credential sources from `.moltbot-env.json` → `credentials` section. Default setup uses macOS Keychain:

| Credential | Config key | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `SOPS_AGE_KEY` | `credentials.sopsAgeKey` | `edit-secrets`, `push-secrets`, `deploy`, `delete-env`, `setup-env-age-key` |
| `CF_ACCESS_API_TOKEN` | `credentials.cfAccessApiToken` | `sync-access`, `create-env`, `delete-env` |

Scripts auto-load credentials from the configured source. You can also export them manually or pass as environment variables.

## Commands

All commands run from an overlay directory (e.g., `cd overlays/<env-name>`):

```bash
make deploy                              # Full deploy pipeline (code + secrets)
make secret KEY=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY        # Set a Wrangler secret interactively
make wrangler CMD='secret list'          # Run arbitrary wrangler command
make wrangler CMD='tail'                 # Stream live logs
make merged-config APP_DIR=/path/to/app  # Inspect final merged config (needs local app repo)
make sync-access                         # Sync CF Access apps (webhook bypass, requires CF_ACCESS_API_TOKEN)
make edit-secrets                        # Edit secrets via SOPS (requires SOPS_AGE_KEY)
make push-secrets                        # Decrypt and bulk-push secrets to Cloudflare
```

## Updating App Version

Edit `overlays/<env>/version.txt` with the target moltbot-app commit SHA, then deploy.

## Key Scripts

- `scripts/jsonc-strip.js` — minimal JSONC-to-JSON converter (handles `//`, `/* */`, trailing commas)
- `scripts/deploy.sh` — orchestrates clone, merge, deploy, and conditional secret push with `set -euo pipefail`
- `scripts/create-env.sh` — bootstraps new environment (R2 bucket, CF Access app, overlay directory, AGE key pair)
- `scripts/delete-env.sh` — tears down environment (Worker, container app, CF Access apps, R2 bucket, overlay, .sops.yaml rule)
- `scripts/sync-access.sh` — reconciles Cloudflare Access Applications: checks current state, creates/deletes webhook bypass app as needed
- `scripts/setup-env-age-key.sh` — generates or regenerates AGE key pair for an environment, updates `.sops.yaml` and re-encrypts secrets

## External Dependencies

Requires `node`, `jq`, `git`, `sops`, `age` (`age-keygen`), and `npx wrangler` available on PATH. The app repo is `https://github.com/<%= appRepo %>`.
